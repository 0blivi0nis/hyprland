# Configuration Variations

With configuration variations, you can prepare different settings and configurations for your Hyprland installation.

## How to use configuration variations

Open the ML4W dotfiles settings app via the ML4W Welcome App, the application launcher or the wheel icon in Waybar.

You can find several variation within the three settings pages.

- Monitor (Screen Resolutions)
- Animations
- Keybindings
- Windows 
- Window Rules
- Decorations
- Environments

Select the variation that you want to use from the corresponding drop down menu.

Please don't edit the shipped configuration variations. These will be overwritten with every update of the ML4W dotfiles. Create your own custom variation instead.

## Create your own variation

Open the ML4W dotfiles settings app via the ML4W Welcome App, the application launcher or the wheel icon in Waybar.

Select "Open Variation Folder" from the variation context menu.

Copy an existing variation as a starting point.

Rename the new file accordingly.

Edit the configuration of your new variation and save.

Go back to the ML4W dotfiles settings app and select "Reload Variations" from the variation context menu.

Select your new variation.
